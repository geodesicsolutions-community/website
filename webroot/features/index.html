									<!-- ########### SCALABILITY &amp; FLEXIBILITY BEGIN ################# -->

									<h2>GeoCore Scalability &amp; Flexibility</h2>
									<div>

											<li><strong>Unlimited Users</strong></li>
											<li><strong>Unlimited Categories and Subcategories</strong> - Built for Flexibility!</li>
											<li><strong>Category by Category Features</strong> - You can set everything on a category by category basis. Want one of your web site categories to have a unique look, questions, pricing, etc...?</li>
											<li><strong>Seamless Updates</strong> - Your site design and settings are stored in the database, allowing for you to receive and implement software updates seamlessly without affecting your existing changes.</li>
											<li><strong>Hosting Portability</strong> - Your MySQL database and files can be backed up and moved to a different host if you wish without losing any of your data...site design, users, listings, everything can be moved.</li>
											<li><strong>Dynamic Extra Pages</strong> - Allows you to create your own extra pages to use for whatever content you wish to display...contact us, about us, pricing schemes, special promo offers, whatever you want.</li>
											<li><strong>Intelligent Thumbnail Scaling</strong> - Specify thumbnail image sizes within the software's admin panel so that your client's imagery display professionally.</li>
											<li><strong>Zip/Postal Code Proximity Search</strong> - Allows your site visitors to perform proximity search (in miles or kilometers) based upon a Zip / Postal Code entered. Requires the <a
													href="free-add-ons/62-zip-postal-code.html">Zip / Postal Code Add On</a>.</li>
											<li><strong>Share User Registrations</strong> - Can be integrated with the GeoCore Bridge Add On, which allows connection to other GeoCore installations, vBulletin, and/or Phorum.</li>
											<li><strong>PHP Source Code NOT Encrypted</strong> - Gives you full access to the PHP Source Code so that you can make edits, enhancements, and feature additions to the software. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Unencrypted Source code
												files are not provided with Leased Licenses.</li>
											<li><strong>"Powered by" Link NOT Required</strong> - Although appreciated, you are <strong>NOT</strong> required to display a 'powered by Geodesic Solutions' icon or link on your site. <strong>NOTE:</strong>For Leased Licenses,
												this option can be added.</li>
											<li><strong>Adaptable for Multiple Industries</strong> - This software can be set up to cater to a wide variety of industries...autos, real estate, boats, horses, personals, jobs, etc...</li>
											<li><strong>Enhanced Email Settings</strong> - Allows you to take advantage of either your server's,Native Mail, Standard SendMail configuration, or SMTP configuration.</li>
											<li><strong>Time Savers</strong> Example: You can copy categories from one to another along with any specific questions. Depending on the setup of your site this alone can save you days of setup time.</li>
											<li><strong>Template Design Flexibility</strong> - The design layer of the software is completely separated from the software source code into Smarty Templates. This allows complete flexibility in design layout just as if you
												were setting up a static html website. From the opening html tag to closing html tag allowing for total customization.</li>
											<li><strong>Module Based Features</strong> - Each feature (module) of the software has it's own specific tag, which allows you to move/edit/delete that tag anywhere within the template that you want the feature to be displayed.
											</li>
											<li><strong>Oodle Feed</strong> - An Oodle feed can be used to send a list of classifieds and auctions on your site to oodle.com. The file can be edited to change settings within the source code to customize various aspects of
												what information the feed displays. This is an advantage to your sellers because not only will they be placing their listing on your site, but they will also have their listing posted into the Oodle network.</li>
											<li><strong>Optimized Site Speed</strong> - The Geo Cache system will cache data, and module output, in cache files. Using the cache system will greatly reduce the amount of data that is retrieved from the database, resulting in
												faster page loads and less strain on the database server.</li>
											<li><strong>Create Unlimited Templates</strong> - Develop individual templates for as many pages as you'd like... html developer's dream. No PHP experience is required!!! Since you can create an unlimited number of templates,
												you can assign a unique template for every page if you want to.</li>
											<li><strong>Ready Made Color Themes</strong> - The software offers many primary and secondary color themes which allows for 100's of possible color combinations. You can mix and match the color themes to suit your needs. The
												original image files are provided as well should you want to change them.</li>
											<li><strong>Create Category Specific Templates</strong> - Develop individual templates and assign a unique template on a category by category basis. In other words, you can have a unique template design for an Automobiles
												category, Real Estate category, Personals category, etc.</li>
											<li><strong>Optional Fields</strong> - These fields are in addition to the standard listing fields (title, description, etc.) and there are several ways to use these fields:</li>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Sortable Columns</strong> - These fields can be set up to be used as 'sortable columns' (sort listings) while browsing the site's categories and search results pages. </li>
												<li><strong>Add Cost</strong> - You can also specify these fields for the seller "add cost" over and above the 'price' field they enter. In other words, the seller can use these fields to specify additional fees (i.e. shipping
													costs) to be added to the "normal price" of the listing. So, for example, at the end of an auction, the software will automatically calculate the winning bid price and add the seller's "additional fees" to the total that the
													winning bidder needs to pay.</li>
												<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - May be set to 'required', 'editable', and you can choose the field type (text, numeric, dropdown box, add cost) to display.</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Additional Featured Listing Levels</strong> - Using the <strong>Featured Level Add On</strong> implement up to 5 levels of featured listings levels. Display each level in a prominent location on your site and charge
												sellers based upon the level of exposure for each level. For example, you could display Level 2 Featured Listings on the front page and charge a premium. You could then display Level 3 Featured Listings on a subcategory page
												and charge less for those listings. Each level has its own individual display settings.</li>

											<li><strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Software gives you the ability to enter meta tags through the admin panel so that the meta tags are applied across all pages of your site. You can enter your meta tags directly into the template
												html just as you would for an ordinary static html file and/or you can enter meta tags on a category by category basis within the admin's category menu.</li>
											<li><strong>Page Title</strong> - Unique titles are dynamically produced for each page by the software based upon the page of your site that the visitor is browsing. For example, if a visitor is browsing the 'Automobiles'
												category, 'Automobiles' will be displayed in the browser's page title. If the visitor is viewing a listing, the actual title of the listing will be used for the browser's page title.</li>
											<li><strong>Unique Urls</strong> - Every page of the software has a distinct URL that can be 'linked to' from other websites. This includes individual categories, subcategories, listings, etc.</li>
											<li><strong>Editable Text Areas</strong> - Every piece of text displayed on the site has a 'text area' associated with it. Since it is a 'text area' and not a 'text field', you can enter 'html' into that area which may be used

									<!-- ########### Listing Display Page Customization BEGIN ################# -->

									<h2>Listing Display Page Customization</h2>
									<div>
										<ul class="check">
											<li><strong>Listing Display Page Template</strong> - The Listing Display Page is driven by a custom template which uses individual tags for virtually all of the fields on the page. This allows you to rearrange the default
												template that we give to you to suit your design needs.</li>
											<li><strong>Category Specific Fields</strong> - You have the ability to create your own custom fields for each category of your site. These fields also serve as searchable criteria for visitors to use on the Search Page.</li>
											<li><strong>Character Limits</strong> - You have the ability to specify the maximum number of characters that the user can use in their title and description fields.</li>
											<li><strong>Photos Display</strong> - Control the number of photos allowed and the format in which they will be displayed on the Listing Display Page. Each photo is clickable and displayed in a popup window. Allows for browsing
												between photos within the popup window.</li>
											<li><strong>YouTube Video Display</strong> - Sellers can upload YouTube Videos within their listings and have those videos embedded (displayed) directly on the Listing Details Page.</li>
											<li><strong>Public Questions / Answers</strong> - Buyers can ask questions to the seller using the "Contact Seller Form" and request (by clicking a checkbox) to have their question be made public. If the seller answers their
												question and agrees (by clicking a checkbox in their "My Communications" section) then that Question/Answer will be displayed on the listing display page for others to view.</li>
											<li><strong>Visitor Counter</strong> - Each listing has a "times viewed" counter which indicates the amount of visitor traffic for that listing.</li>
											<li><strong>HTML Editor</strong> - This editor can be turned on for the seller to use when they are listing their item. It allows them to customize the colors/fonts/layout of their listing's description.</li>
											<li><strong>Standard Links</strong> - The Listing Display Page offers several customizable links that will take your visitors to several software driven pages: <strong>Tell-a-Friend, Contact Seller, Add To Favorites, Seller's
													Other Listings, Mapping, Print Friendly, Storefront</strong></li>
											<li><strong>Photo Title</strong> - The user can give each photo they upload a distinct title. For example, in the Real Estate category the seller may want to label their photos: Master Bedroom, Entry Hallway, Brick Fireplace,
												etc.</li>
											<li><strong>Map Display</strong> - Offers the ability to display mapping information using <strong>Google Maps API</strong> or <strong>MapQuest Map API</strong> on the listing details page.</li>
											<li><strong>Lightbox Display</strong> - Ability to show your listing's photos in the popular Lightbox format.</li>
											<li><strong>Filmstrip View</strong> - Ability to show your listing's thumbnails in a scrolling filmstrip format rather than a table of thumbnail images.</li>
											<li><strong>Additional Fields</strong> - Additional fields that have the capability to be used not only on the Listing Display Page, but also as "sortable columns" within the category browsing pages. For example, if you were
												running a Real Estate specific site, you might use these fields for: Number of Bedrooms, Number of Baths, and Year Built. These fields would display on the listing display page, as well as, within the browsing categories
												tables of your site. So visitors would be able to sort listings by any one of those three fields.</li>
											<li><strong>SOLD Sign</strong> - The seller can optionally display a SOLD sign image for each of their listings. This allows them to take advantage of the full duration of the listing they paid for, but not be contacted for
												potential buyers for that item. You can replace the software's default 'sold' image with your own, so that it displays your own custom image, such as "Under Contract", or "Check Back Soon!".</li>
											<li><strong>Checkbox Question </strong> - This type of 'extra question' allows the seller to check off features of their item. Consequently, their 'checked' answers will display as 'checkboxes' on the Listing Display Page. This
												type of question is typically used when asking questions such as Real Estate property features or Automobile features.</li>
											<li><strong>Lead Picture</strong> - Allows you to display the seller's first photo larger than their other photos and in a different location on the Listing Display Page.</li>
											<li><strong>Splash Page During Listing Process</strong> - You can optionally display a Splash Page (displays html content) when user begins the listing process. The Splash Page can be used to advertise another product, review a
												price plan, etc. Each User Group can have their own Splash Page.</li>
											<li><strong>Vote and Comment</strong> - You can give users the ability to vote on ad. They can leave a comment and vote.</li>
											<li><strong>Popup Listing Display Page</strong> - You can set the site so that when a visitor selects a listing for viewing while browsing, a new popup window will open and display the Listing Display Page rather than a typical
												redirect to the Listing Display Page.</li>
											<li><strong>Listing Preview</strong> - At the end of the listing process, the seller can click the 'preview' button to see what their listing will look like once it is 'active' on your site.</li>

									<h2>Auction Specific Features</h2>
									<div>
										<ul class="check">
											<li><strong>Standard Auctions</strong> - Feature allows sellers to place their individual items up for auction.</li>
											<li><strong>Dutch Auctions (Multiple Item Auctions)</strong> - Feature allows sellers to post several identical items or "lots" of items up for auction. Bidders will then bid a certain amount per item on a selected number of
												those items. This type of auction has the potential of having several winning bidders on the same auction...each bidder winning a certain number of items.</li>
											<li><strong>Reverse Auctions</strong> - This auction type is virtually the same as the standard auction except that bidding goes lower instead of higher or more specifically the roles of the buyer and seller are reversed. In
												this auction type sellers compete to obtain business. </li>
											<li><strong>Minimum Bid</strong> - This feature allows the seller to set the minimum starting bid for the auction.</li>
											<li><strong>Reserve Bid</strong> - This feature allows the seller to specify the minimum amount they are willing to accept for their auction from a bidder.</li>
											<li><strong>"Buy Now" Auction</strong> - This feature allows willing bidders to purchase the auction item immediately at the seller's specified "Buy Now" price.</li>
											<li><strong>Proxy Bidding</strong> - Sometimes called "auto-bidding" or "absentee bidding", this feature allows the bidder to enter the maximum amount that they are willing to pay for the item and then walk away. The software
												will then automatically bid on their behalf up to the amount they specified...absentee bidding!</li>
											<li><strong>User/Seller Feedback Rating System</strong> - This feature allows the seller and winning bidder of each auction to rate each other and provide a comment on how well the transaction went. The system uses "icons" that
												represent a user's favorable or 'not so' favorable feedback ratings. For instance, by default the system uses colored stars to represent each user's feedback. You can easily replace the default star images with your own if you
												like.</li>
											<li><strong>Final Fees</strong> - Upon successful completion of an auction, you can charge the 'seller' a percentage fee based upon the 'final' selling price of the item.</li>
											<li><strong>Bid Status</strong> - Bidders can view the current status of their bids by logging in to their personal "My Account" pages.</li>
											<li><strong>Seller Emails</strong> - The software will send an email to the seller when their listing has been successfully placed on your site. Additionally, the seller will receive emails when their auction is about to expire,
												when the auction has been "unsuccessful", and when the auction has received a winning bidder.</li>

												allowed to place bids on the user's auctions. All other users on the site can place bids on the user's auctions.</li>
											<li><strong>Auction Start / End Time</strong> - You can give the seller the ability to set a specific date and time for each auction to begin and end, rather than the auction simply going live immediately after placing the
												auction.</li>
											<li><strong>Auction Preview Period</strong> - If allowing your sellers to specify the Auction Start / End Time, you can also set your site so that these auctions can be previewed on your site. All of the Listing details will be
												available to visitors of your site. However, they will not be able to place bids on the items until the seller's specified Start Time arrives.</li>
											<li><strong>Subscription Based Bidding</strong> - You can set up your site so that each user must have a subscription to place a bid and/or even view an auction.</li>
											<li><strong>Endless Auctions (Sniper bidding)</strong> - This feature automatically extends the length of an auction if a user bids just before the auction was to end. You can specify the number of minutes prior to expiration
												that the system should check for a successful bid. If a successful bid is detected within that time, the auction will be extended for the number of minutes you specify. This process will continue over and over until all
												bidding has stopped.</li>
											<li><strong>Seller to Buyer Gateway (PayPal)</strong> - Sellers can accept payments from buyers (winning bidders) for successful auctions using their PayPal accounts. Seller can enter their PayPal id into their account which
												will indicate that the seller accepts this form of payment from buyers.</li>
